The word “polymorphism” means having many forms.

Types of Polymorphism:-
1. Compile-time Polymorphism
2. Runtime Polymorphism

1. Compile-Time Polymorphism
This type of polymorphism is achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.

A. Function Overloading
When there are multiple functions with the same name but different parameters, then the functions are said to be overloaded, hence this is known as Function Overloading. Functions can be overloaded by changing the number of arguments or/and changing the type of arguments. In simple terms, it is a feature of object-oriented programming providing many functions that have the same name but distinct parameters when numerous tasks are listed under one function name.
B. Operator Overloading
C++ has the ability to provide the operators with a special meaning for a data type, this ability is known as operator overloading.
